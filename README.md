## Variables

Variables are a mix of different conventions to get a standard usage, ideas where taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/colors/#variables), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette) and IDE themes.

All themes have their original colors with there original names, but I also
added alias to some colors so every theme have consistent and standard variable
conventions based on the RGB color wheel, additionally there are variables like
`$primary` or `$selection` as more semantic utilities.

For this [this tools](https://www.colorhexa.com/) was used to find the color of
the colorscheme more close to the standard color.

All the colors (Original and semantic) where used to generate all the
utilities, so you have for example `text-lavender` (original), `text-green` (standard) and
`text-success` (semantic)
