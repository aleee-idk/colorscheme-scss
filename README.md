## Variables

Variables are a mix of different conventions to get a standard usage, ideas where taken from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/colors/#variables), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette) and IDE themes.

All themes have their original colors with there original names, but I also
added alias to some colors so every theme have a consistent variable
conventions, additionally there are variables like `$primary` or `$selection` as
more semantic utilities.
